Big O notation: Calculate time complexity 

Time complexity:
Common unit: O(1), O(n), O(logN), O(NlogN), O(N^2), O(2^N)

Big O: maximum possible computation time of a program
When a program have time complexity O(N), we know it could not be run slower then O(N)

Big Omega: minimum possible computation time of a program
When a program have time complexity Omega(N), we know it could not be run faster then Omega(N)
